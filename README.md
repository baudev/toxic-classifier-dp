# Toxic comment classifier

This is a deep learning model trained using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to identify and classify toxic online comments. The dataset comes from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

We exported our model and implemented it into a website with Tensorflow.js. **You can try it out at https://baudev.github.io/toxic-classifier-dp/**
